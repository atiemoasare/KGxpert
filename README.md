## Overview

The KGxpert is designed to simplify the creation, querying, visualization, and management of knowledge graphs. This suite provides a comprehensive solution for working with knowledge graphs, from querying and visualizing to managing and modifying data.

## Features

### KGQL (Knowledge Graph Query Language)
- **Declarative Querying**: Enables specifying queries using a user-friendly and concise syntax, abstracting the underlying graph structure.
- **Typed Entities and Relationships**: Enforces strict typing on entities and relationships, ensuring data consistency and type safety.
- **Rule-Based Data Generation**: Allows defining rules to automatically generate knowledge graph data based on existing information.
- **Extensible Vocabulary**: Supports a customizable vocabulary to represent domain-specific concepts, allowing for tailored knowledge graph schemas.

### KGVis (Knowledge Graph Visualizer)
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Enables exploring the knowledge graph as a visual representation, with nodes representing entities and edges representing relationships.
- **Filter and Search**: Provides options to filter and search for entities based on type, relationships, or properties.
- **Data Manipulation**: Allows for adding, modifying, and deleting entities and relationships through a user-friendly interface.

### KGDash (Knowledge Graph Dashboard)
- **Source of Truth for LLMs**: Acts as the central repository for the knowledge graph, providing a trusted source of information for language models.
- **No-Code Modification**: Empowers users to make modifications to the knowledge graph without writing code, using a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Versioning and History**: Tracks changes to the knowledge graph over time, allowing for easy version control and rollback.
